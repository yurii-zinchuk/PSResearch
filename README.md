 # P&SResearch
 
 For this project we analyze smokers/ non - smokers dataset, especially dependence of their age, sex, health measurements.
 
 The dataset : [Body signal of smoking](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kukuroo3/body-signal-of-smoking) .It is  found on the Kaggle website, containing more than 55 thousand people's data, along with whether they smoke or not. On the Kaggle website, there is a parsed version of the original based on the National Health Insurance Service Health Checkup Information, taken from here. There are 27 categories of people’s personal info such as height, weight, age and health conditions.

The dataset looks in this way:

For analysis we can use such variables as “gender”, “age”, “height”, “weight”,”hemoglobin”, “smoking” and other health parameters.

**The parameter smoke denotes 0 as non-smoker and 1 as smoker**.

From the initial analysis of data, we saw that there are significant differences in the health of smokers and non-smokers. Also, the fraction of male smokers  is much bigger than  female’s ones. Also we noticed that the mode of the smoker’s dataset in both gender is 40 years.

**In this research we will test the following hypotheses:**

1) The distribution of smokers/non-smoker ratio is exponentially distributed.

2) The number of smokers, depending on people’s age is normally distributed.

3) The mean age of smokers are more equal than 40.

4) There is no significant difference in the hemoglobin mean of smokers and non-smokers.

5) There is no relation between eyesight and being smoker/non smoker.
